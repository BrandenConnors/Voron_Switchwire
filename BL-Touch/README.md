This is a Modification to the Afterburner's Tolhead, to accept the touch Sensor (AKA BL-Touch, 3D Touch, etc.)
For this Mod you can use the two M3x10 screws. 
The M3x20 screws and the Probe Bracket are no longer needed.

It is highly recommened to use any available insulation material to reduce heat on the touch Sensor.
